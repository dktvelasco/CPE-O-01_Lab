===============================================================================
Projects:

1. Add three methods to the Student class that compare two Student objects. One 
method should test for equality. A second method should test for less than. The 
third method should test for greater than or equal to. In each case, the method 
returns the result of the comparison of the two students’ names. Include a main
function that tests all of the comparison operators.

2. This project assumes that you have completed Project 1. Place several Student
objects into a list and shuffle it. Then run the sort method with this list and 
display all of the students’ information.

3. The str method of the Bank class returns a string containing the accounts in 
random order. Design and implement a change that causes the accounts to be placed 
in the string by order of name. (Hint: You will also have to define some methods 
in the SavingsAccount class.)
